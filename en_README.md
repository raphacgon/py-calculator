//Simple Calculator in Python//

This is a simple calculator program developed in Python that allows the user to perform basic mathematical operations.
//Features//

Performs the following operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division (with error handling for division by zero)
Prompts the user for two numbers and returns the result of the chosen operation.
Converts input numbers to integers when displaying the final results.
Uses a separator line to improve the readability of the interface.
//How to Use//

Run the Python program.
Choose the desired operation by typing the corresponding number:
1 for Addition

2 for Subtraction

3 for Multiplication

4 for Division

Enter the two numbers you want to calculate.
The program displays the result of the chosen operation.
After viewing the result, press Enter to continue.

Example Usage //OUT:

Choose an operation: '1' for ADDITION '2' for SUBTRACTION '3' for MULTIPLICATION '4' for DIVISION

What is the first value? 10

What is the second value? 5

10 + 5 = 15 The result of adding 10 and 5 is 15.//

//Requirements//

Python 3.x installed on the machine.

//Running the Program//

To run the program, open a terminal or command prompt and execute:

python calculadora.py

Make sure you are in the correct directory where the calculadora.py file is saved.

//Possible Future Improvements//

Add support for more mathematical operations (exponentiation, square root, etc.).

Allow input of integer or decimal numbers without automatic rounding.

Create a loop so the user can perform multiple operations without restarting the program.

Implement a graphical interface for a better user experience.
